# CityQuest

This is the source code of a sightseeing app written in Ionic 2, AngularJS and NodeJS.

The GitHub repository has 4 actively used branches. The **master** branch has the latest stable version, while the **ionic** and **backend** branches have the new updates for the front and backend respectively. The **cleanup** branch is used to merge backend and frontend modifications, and to clean the source code before uploading to **master**.

How to test the Ionic 2 app:

1. First of all, you should have `npm` installed.
2. Clone the repository to a directory in your local environment
3. Run the `npm install` command to install all required dependencies
4. Run the server by opening a command-line interface in the `server` folder and typing `node app.js`
5. Run the Ionic app by typing `ionic serve` in your local directory
