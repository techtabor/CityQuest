# CityQuest

This is the source code of a sightseeing app written in Ionic 2 and AngularJS

Currently, there are two versions of the app on the GitHub repository. On the **master** branch, you can find a core framework of the application, with basic HTML interface and Node.js server, whereas on the **ionic** branch you can find the Ionic 2 app along with the code of the server.

How to test the Ionic 2 app:

1. First of all, you should have `npm` installed.
2. Clone the repository to a directory in your local environment
3. Run the `npm install` command to install all required dependencies
4. Run the server by opening a command-line interface in the `server` folder and typing `node app.js`
5. Run the Ionic app by typing `ionic serve` in your local directory
